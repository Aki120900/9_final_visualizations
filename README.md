Visual Analysis of Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Japan (1925-2024).

Project Description:

This project provides a comprehensive visual analysis of earthquakes and tsunamis in Japan over the past 100 years, from 1925 to 2024. 
It includes a series of static and interactive visualizations that highlight the frequency, magnitude, and impacts of these natural disasters. 
The visualizations aim to offer valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and the general public, enhancing their understanding and preparedness for future seismic events.
